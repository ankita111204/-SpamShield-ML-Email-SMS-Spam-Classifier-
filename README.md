-SpamShield-ML-Email-SMS-Spam-Classifier-
The name clearly communicates the primary function of the tool - protecting against spam. "Shield" evokes a strong image of defense and protection, which is exactly what the classifier aims to provide.

A machine learning-powered spam classifier that detects and filters spam messages from emails and SMS. This project follows a structured approach, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), text processing, model building, evaluation, and deployment as a web application.

📂-PROJECT OVERVIEW-
Spam messages are a growing issue in emails and SMS. SpamShield uses Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) techniques and Machine Learning algorithms to classify messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) with high accuracy.

📌-KEY FEATURES-
✅ Email & SMS Spam Detection – Detects spam using ML models. ✅ Comprehensive Text Processing – Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and vectorization. ✅ Multiple ML Models – Naïve Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, and Deep Learning models. ✅ Web-Based Interface – Deployable as a website or API.

📊-Dataset-
The dataset consists of labeled Spam and Ham(not spam) messages. Common sources include: 📌 SMS Spam Collection 📌 Enron Email Dataset The data is cleaned and preprocessed for model training.

🛠-PROJECT STEPS-
1️⃣ Data Cleaning Removed unnecessary characters, punctuation, and whitespace. Converted text to lowercase for consistency.

Removed numbers and special symbols.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Analyzed word frequency distributions. Visualized spam vs. ham word clouds. Checked dataset balance (spam/ham ratio).
